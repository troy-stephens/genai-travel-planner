The code provided uses the `FeaturizeText` transformation in ML.NET to convert text data into numerical feature vectors. This transformation creates a Bag-of-Words (BoW) representation of the text, which is a common technique in natural language processing (NLP).  
   
Here's a detailed explanation of how the `FeaturizeText` transformation works and how it differs from embeddings:  
   
### Bag-of-Words (BoW) Representation  
   
1. **Tokenization**: The text is split into individual words or tokens.  
2. **Vocabulary Building**: A vocabulary of all unique tokens in the dataset is created.  
3. **Vectorization**: Each text (sentence or document) is converted into a vector. The length of the vector is equal to the size of the vocabulary. Each element in the vector represents the count (or frequency) of the corresponding token in the vocabulary.  
   
### Example:  
Consider the following two sentences:  
   
- "The cat sat on the mat."  
- "The dog sat on the log."  
   
The vocabulary would be: `[the, cat, sat, on, mat, dog, log]`  
   
The vectors for each sentence would be:  
- Sentence 1: `[2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]`  
- Sentence 2: `[2, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1]`  
   
### How `FeaturizeText` Works in ML.NET  
   
The `FeaturizeText` transformation essentially automates the above process. It tokenizes the text, builds a vocabulary, and creates vectors based on the frequency of each token.  
   
### Embedding Models  
   
Embeddings, such as Word2Vec, GloVe, or BERT, are more advanced techniques compared to BoW. They convert words into dense vectors of fixed size, where semantically similar words are placed closer together in the vector space. These vectors are learned from large corpora of text and capture the contextual meaning of words.  
   
### Differences Between BoW and Embeddings  
   
- **BoW**: Simple, sparse vectors, based on token frequency. Does not capture semantic meaning.  
- **Embeddings**: Dense vectors, capture semantic meaning, can handle out-of-vocabulary words better through pre-trained models.
